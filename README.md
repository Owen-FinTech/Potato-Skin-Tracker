# Potato-Skin-Tracker
Website for potatoskintracker.com which tracks the number of carry violations called by NBA refs, with projections as to whether we will break the 100 carry mark for the season. Inspired by wedgietracker.com

About this site: “Looking like a waiter bringing out a (some) potato skins appetiser”, acts as a description of a carry (where a player illegally places their hand under the ball while dribbling). First conceived by JE Skeets on No Dunks episode ‘Are We Watching The Greatest Team In NBA History? | The Drop’ on 12/12/2025 from the Worst Of The Week segment @ 44:53 featuring the (as described by Tas Melas) ‘brutal’ Andrew Nembhard carry that was not called. “WHO ORDERED THE POTATO SKINS?” says Trey Kirby, and thus history was made in that moment.
